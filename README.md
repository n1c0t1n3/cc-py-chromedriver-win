CC-PY-Chromedriver (Windows version) v1.0

<-- What is this? -->

CC-PY-Chromedriver (W) is a program that will facilitate the authentication and management of mega.nz clouds. The user will be able to easily connect to his accounts (as many as he wants in the same time) without typing the password / email several times or logging out to access another cloud

<-- How to use -->

First check if you have Chrome browser and python installed. If not, install them. Then check if you have Chromedriver already downloaded. If not, download chromedriver (watch your Chrome-browser version) and put the driver inside the ‘driver’ folder. If there is no ‘driver’ folder you can create one manually.

To start the program simply run python cc-py-chromedriver.pyc from CMD (Terminal) or double click on cc-py-chromedriver.pyc
